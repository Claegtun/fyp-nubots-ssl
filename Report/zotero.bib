	abstract = {Sound source localization (SSL) in a robotic platform has been essential in the overall scheme of robot audition. It allows a robot to locate a sound source by sound alone. It has an important impact on other robot audition modules, such as source separation, and it enriches human–robot interaction by complementing the robot’s perceptual capabilities. The main objective of this review is to thoroughly map the current state of the SSL field for the reader and provide a starting point to SSL in robotics. To this effect, we present: the evolution and historical context of SSL in robotics; an extensive review and classification of SSL techniques and popular tracking methodologies; different facets of SSL as well as its state-of-the-art; evaluation methodologies used for SSL; and a set of challenges and research motivations.},

Artificial audition systems on robots currently exist, but no evaluation of the methods used to localize sound sources has yet been conducted. This paper presents an evaluation of various real-time audio localization algorithms using a medium-sized microphone array which is suitable for applications in robotics. The techniques studied here are implementations and enhancements of steered response power - phase transform beamformers, which represent the most popular methods for time difference of arrival audio localization. In addition, two different grid topologies for implementing source direction search are also compared. Results show that a direction refinement procedure can be used to improve localization accuracy and that more efficient and accurate direction searches can be performed using a uniform triangular element grid rather than the typical rectangular element grid.},

Moreover, a rejection strategy is presented to evaluate the correctness of the delay difference values. And then, the device’s geometric equations based on the time-space mapping relationship are established to calculate the position of the sound source. For fast solving the equations, the multimicrophone array space is divided into several subspaces to narrow the solution range, and Newton iteration algorithm is introduced to solve the equations, while its solution is evaluated by an evaluation mechanism based on coordinate thresholds. Finally, some experiments are carried out to verify the performance of the device, of which the results show that the device can achieve sound source localization with a high accuracy.},

The two methods, discrete Kalman filter and time delay of arrival (TDOA) using generalized cross-correlation (GCC), are combined by quantifying reliability of TDOA. The combination prevents the deterioration by low power of signals, noise, and reverberation because discrete Kalman filter efficiently filters out such effects.

The properties of the statistical model are found to correlate well with results from real data measurements. The room transfer function model is further applied to analyze the statistical properties of some existing methods for source localization. In this respect we consider especially the asymptotic error variance and the probability of an anomalous estimate. A noteworthy outcome of the analysis is that the so-called PHAT time-delay estimator is shown to be optimal among a class of cross-correlation based time-delay estimators. To verify our results on the error variance and the outlier probability we apply the image method for simulation of the room transfer function.},

However, large and usually complex distributed microphone arrays are used for three-dimensional acoustic source localization. This study proposes a convolutional neural network architecture for three-dimensional sound source localization using a single tetrahedral microphone array. A spectrum phase component of a microphone array signal was designed as the input of the model, while the output represents a three-dimensional space. The paper provides extensive experimental results of the given method on a semi-synthetic audio data set and a real-world microphone array. Furthermore, cluster-based post-processing has been shown to increase the accuracy of three-dimensional localization by more than 30\%. The experimental results on a synthesized data set using the image source method showed 1.08 m localization uncertainties. The estimate of the investigated sound sources had a mean absolute error of 18.97° and elevation error of 48.49°. An additional advantage of the proposed method is the ability to predict the location of the sound source from a single signal analysis frame. This gives instant localization and is in line with many alternative applications. The proposed solution does not require intensive preprocessing of the audio signals and can be used as a video camera pointing system based on a microphone array. In the future, it would be relevant to investigate the localization performance of more than two sound sources, and the variable acoustic conditions could also be assessed.},

	abstract = {The higher computational efficiency of the time difference of arrival (TDOA) based sound source localization makes it a preferred choice over steered response power (SRP) methods in real-time applications. However, unlike SRP, its implementation for multiple source localization (MSL) is not straight forward. It includes challenges as accurate feature extraction in unfavourable acoustic conditions, association ambiguity involved in mapping the feature extractions to the corresponding sources and complexity involved in solving the hyperbolic delay equation to estimate the source coordinates. Moreover, the dominating source and early reverberation make the detection of delay associated with the submissive sources further perplexing. Hence, this paper proposes a proficient three-step method for localizing multiple sources from delay estimates. In step 1, the search space region is partitioned into cubic subvolumes, and the delay bound associated with each one is computed. Hereafter, these subvolumes are grouped differently, such that whose associated TDOA bounds are enclosed by a specific delay interval, are clustered together. In step 2, initially, the delay segments and later each subvolume contained by the corresponding delay segment are traced for passing through estimated delay hyperbola. These traced volumes are updated by the weight to measure the likelihood of a source in it. The resultant generates the delay density map in the search space. In the final step, localization enhancement is carried out in the selected volumes using conventional SRP (C-SRP). The validation of the proposed approach is done by carrying out the experiments under different acoustic conditions on the synthesized data and, recordings from SMARD \& Audio Visual 16.3 Corpus.},
