Scope:
	Goals:
		Challenging:
			- Localise more than one source,
			- Incorporate a communication protocol with other robots,
			- Detect a quick short sound, e.g. a snap,
		Ideal:
			- Localise three-dimensionally with range and bearing,
			- Help the overall localisation of the robot,
			- Have real-time signal-processing and localisation, i.e. processing in parallel with 	acquisition,
			- Have a wide bandwidth, e.g. ultrasonic sounds as well as audible,
			- Detect a more varied sound, e.g. voice,
		Basic:
			- Localise at least two-dimensionally with range and bearing,
			- Process and acquire at least serially, i.e. switch between the two,
			- Communicate with the NUC,
			- Detect at least audible sounds,
			- Detect at least a strong constant sound, e.g. a whistle,
	Questions:
		- What is the method of localisation, either time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA), beamforming, or something else?
		- Where is the computation? Should it be on an STM32, DSP, SBC, NUC, etc.?
		- What microphones are best? They should preferrably be omnidirectional.
		- Which kind of signal is best? Should it be analogue or digital? The sampling requirements will set this criterion.
		- What level of electronics design is there? If analogue microphones are to be used, then fitlering may be needed.
